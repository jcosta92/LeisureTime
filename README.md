Aren’t you tired of choosing a random movie or book to see or watch? 
The objective of this project is to give you daily recommendations on movies and books, depending on the specific day in question. We have celebrities’ birthdays, international days and anniversaries of certain events, such as famous battles.
This project that originates *Leisure Time – Movie&Book Recommendation System* is based on an NLP model that was specifically searched for the purpose of connecting one description into another one.
