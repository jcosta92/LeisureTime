1030-07-29,Battle of Stiklestad,,1030,7,29,"The Battle of Stiklestad (Norwegian: Slaget på Stiklestad, Old Norse: Stiklarstaðir) in 1030 is one of the most famous battles in the history of Norway. In this battle, King Olaf II of Norway (Óláfr Haraldsson) was killed. During the pontificate of Pope Alexander III, the Roman Catholic Church declared Olaf a saint in 1164.[1] His younger half-brother, Harald Hardrada (Haraldr Haraldsson harðráði), was also present at the battle. Harald was only fifteen when the battle of Stiklestad took place. He became King of Norway in 1047, until his death in a failed invasion of England at the Battle of Stamford Bridge in 1066. The authenticity of the battle as a historical event is subject to question. Contemporary sources say the king was murdered. According to the Anglo Saxon Chronicle of 1030, Olaf was killed by his own people. Adam of Bremen wrote in 1070 that Olaf was killed in an ambush, and so did Florence of Worcester in 1100. Those are the only contemporary sources that mention the death of the king. After the king's canonization it was felt that the saint could not have died in such circumstances. The story of the Battle of Stiklestad as most know it gradually developed during the two centuries following the death of King Olaf. Since he was sainted, Olaf must have fallen in a major battle for Christianity.[2] During the 9th century, Norway was divided between several local kings controlling their own fiefs. By the end of the century, King Harald Fairhair (Old Norse: Haraldr Hárfagri) managed, mainly due to the military superiority gained by his marriage alliance with Hákon Grjótgarðsson of Nidaros, to subjugate these mini–kingdoms, and he created a unified Norwegian state. This alliance came apart after Harald's death. The jarls of Lade and various descendants of Harald Fairhair would spend the next century interlocked in feuds over power. As well as power politics, religion also played a part in these conflicts, as two of the descendants of Harald Fairhair, Haakon the Good and Olaf Tryggvason attempted to convert the then heathen Norwegians to Christianity. In the year 1000, Sveinn Hákonarson and Eiríkr Hákonarson (Old Norse: Eiríkr) of Lade took control over Norway, being supported by the Danish King Sveinn Forkbeard (Sveinn Haraldsson tjúguskegg). In 1015, Olaf Haraldsson, representing the descendants of Harald Fairhair, returned from one of his Viking trips and was immediately elected as King of Norway. In June 1016, he won the Battle of Nesjar against the jarls of Lade.

1210-07-29,Siege of Minerve,,1210,7,29,"Languedoc War Languedoc Revolt Royal intervention and aftermath The siege of Minerve was a military engagement which took place in June and July 1210 during the Albigensian Crusade in the town of Minerve in southern France. It was undertaken by the Catholic Crusaders against the Cathars in southern France, who were regarded as a heretical sect. The Crusaders, led by French nobleman Simon de Montfort, besieged and captured the town. The Crusaders allowed the soldiers defending the town, Catholics, and any Cathars who had not yet reached the status of perfect to go free. Three Cathar perfects who repented were pardoned, but 140 others who refused to do so were burnt at the stake. The Albigensian Crusade was initiated in the Kingdom of France at the behest of Pope Innocent III. Its purpose was to squash the growing Cathar movement, which flourished mainly in the Languedoc region of what later became Southern France.[1] The immediate cause was the killing of the papal legate, Pierre de Castelnau.[2] The Crusaders set out in the summer of 1209.[3] After several military victories, they were able to capture many towns without a fight.[4] After the fall of Carcassonne, papal legate Arnaud Amalric, who had led troops during the Massacre at Béziers, was replaced as commander of the Crusader force by Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester, although Amalric continued to accompany the army.[5] ",http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Minerve.jpg,Joan of Arc,"In the 15th Century, France is a defeated and ruined nation after the One Hundred Years War against England.

1545-07-29,Battle of the Solent,,1545,7,29," The naval Battle of the Solent took place on 18 and 19 July 1545 during the Italian Wars between the fleets of Francis I of France and Henry VIII of England, in the Solent, between Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. This was one of only two full-fledged naval battles fought by King Henry VIII's Tudor navy, along with the earlier Battle of Saint-Mathieu. The engagement was inconclusive, and is most notable for the sinking of the English carrack, Mary Rose. In 1545, France launched an invasion of England with 30,000 soldiers in more than 200 ships. Against this armada—larger than the Spanish Armada 43 years later—the English had about 12,000 soldiers and 80 ships. The French expedition started disastrously, the flagship Carraquon being destroyed on 6 July in an accidental fire whilst at anchor in the Seine. Admiral Claude d'Annebault transferred his flag to La Maistresse, which then ran aground as the fleet set sail. The leaks were patched up and the fleet crossed the Channel. The French entered the Solent and landed troops on the Isle of Wight.[2] On 18 July, the English came out of Portsmouth and engaged the French at long range, little damage being done on either side. La Maitresse was close to sinking due to her earlier damage but, although d'Annebault had to change his flagship again, she was saved.

1693-07-29,Battle of Landen,,1693,7,29," The Battle of Landen, also known as Neerwinden, took place on 29 July 1693, during the Nine Years' War near  Landen in modern Belgium. A French army under Marshal Luxembourg defeated an Allied force led by William III. By 1693, all combatants were struggling with the financial and material costs of the conflict. Hoping to end the war with a favourable negotiated peace, Louis XIV of France decided first to improve his position by taking the offensive. Luxembourg, French commander in the Spanish Netherlands saw a chance to engage William near Landen. The allies were in a strong but extremely dangerous position, with a river to their rear.  Most of the fighting took place on the Allied right, around the only bridge over the river, which was strongly fortified and defended by the bulk of their artillery. The French assaulted the position three times before finally breaking through the defences; the Allies were forced to retreat and abandon their guns.  Although a clear French victory, as with the Battle of Steenkerque the previous year, both sides suffered heavy casualties and Louis failed to achieve the decisive result that would force the Allies to negotiate peace. William quickly replaced his losses and by 1694 had achieved numerical superiority in Flanders for the first time in the war.

1894-07-29,Battle of Seonghwan,,1894,7,29," The Battle of Seonghwan (成歓の戦い) was the first major land battle of the First Sino-Japanese War. It took place on 29 July 1894 at the hamlet of Seonghwan, outside of Cheonan, Chungcheongnam-do Korea between the forces of Meiji Japan and Qing China. It is also referred to as the Battle of Asan (Japanese: 牙山作戦 ). Following the capture of the Royal Palace at Seoul and disarmament of the Korean troops, the Japanese began preparations for an attack against Chinese forces camped at Asan. On 25 July, charged with implementing the Imperial Japanese Army's commission from new Korean government to expel the Chinese Beiyang Army from Korean territory by force, a detachment of the Japanese First Army consisting of 4,000 men and four artillery pieces under command of Major General Ōshima Yoshimasa marched south from Seoul towards the major port city of Asan.[2] The Chinese forces stationed near Seonghwan numbered about 3,880 men under General Ye Zhichao, and had anticipated the impending arrival of the Japanese by fortifying their position with trenches, earthworks including six redoubts protected by abatis and by flooding surrounding rice fields.[3] However, expected  Chinese reinforcements from Taku, had been lost in the naval Battle of Pungdo on 25 July 1894, in which the British-chartered transport Kowshing had been sunk.[4] Units of the Chinese main force were deployed east and north-east of Asan, near the main road leading to Seoul, the key positions held by the Chinese were the towns of Seonghwan and Cheonan. Approximately 3,000 troops were stationed at Seonghwan, while 1,000 men along with General's headquarters were at the Cheonan. The remaining Chinese troops were garrisoned in Asan itself.[2] The Chinese had been preparing for a pincer movement against the Korean capital by massing troops at Pyongyang in the north and Asan in the south.[5] The Japanese began their attack with a small diversionary force consisting of four companies of infantry and one of engineers attacking Chinese positions on the night of 28 July 1894 from the front, while the main force of nine companies of infantry, one of cavalry and a battalion of artillery successfully outflanked the Chinese defenses by crossing the Ansong River.[3] The battle lasted from about 03:30 to 05:30 in the early morning of 28 July 1894. The defenders, after a sharp engagement, were unable to hold Seonghwan, and fled to Asan, ten miles to the southwest, leaving behind a considerable amount of weapons and stores.[3] ",http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/16126.d.1%2846%29-Long%20live%20the%20Great%20Japanese%20Empire%21%20Our%20army%27s%20victorious%20attack%20on%20Seonghwan.jpg,Pork Chop Hill,"Korean War, April 1953.

1911-07-29,First Universal Races Congress,,1911,7,29," The First Universal Races Congress met in 1911 for four days at the University of London as an early effort at anti-racism. Speakers from a number of countries discussed race relations and how to improve them.[1] The congress, with 2,100 attendees, was organised by prominent humanists of that era; it was conceived of a result of comments in 1906 by Felix Adler and primarily executed by Gustav Spiller, a leader in the British Ethical Union (now Humanists UK). Philip Stanhope was president of the congress, and William Pember Reeves chaired its executive committee.[2]  The call for the congress included these remarks:To discuss, in the light of science and modern conscience, the general relations subsisting between the peoples of the West and those of the East, between the so-called ""white"" and the so-called ""colored"" peoples, with a view to encouraging between them a fuller understanding, the most friendly feelings, and the heartier co-operation.… The interchange of material and other wealth between the races of mankind has of late years assumed such dimensions that the old attitude of distrust and aloofness is giving way to a genuine desire for a closer acquaintanceship. Out of this interesting situation has sprang the idea of holding a Congress where the representatives of the different races might meet each other face to face, and might, in friendly rivalry, further the cause of mutual trust and respect between the Occident and Orient, between the so-called ""white"" peoples and the so-called ""colored"" peoples.[3][4]More than 50 countries and 20 governments sent representatives, resulting in 58 papers which were categorized into five groups:[3] Resolutions resulting from the congress were:[3] ",http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Universal%20Races%20Congress%20seated%20outside%20the%20entrance%20to%20the%20Imperial%20Institute%2C%20London%2C%201911.jpg,Uncle Tom,"In a collection of intimate interviews with some of America's most provocative black conservative thinkers, Uncle Tom takes a unique look at being black in America.

In this eye-opening film from Director Justin Malone and Executive Producer Larry Elder, Uncle Tom examines self-empowerment, individualism and rejecting the victim narrative. Uncle Tom shows us a different perspective of American History from this often ignored and ridiculed group.",Once Brothers,"Drazen Petrovic and Vlade Divac were two friends who grew up together sharing the common bond of basketball. Together, they lifted the Yugoslavian National team to unimaginable heights. After conquering Europe, they both went to USA where they became the first two foreign players to attain NBA stardom. But with the fall of the Soviet Union on Christmas Day 1991, Yugoslavia split up. A war broke out between Petrovic's Croatia and Divac's Serbia. Long buried ethnic tensions surfaced. And these two men, once brothers, were now on opposite sides of a deadly civil war. As Petrovic and Divac continued to face each other on the basketball courts of the NBA, no words passed between the two. Then, on the fateful night of June 7, 1993, Drazen Petrovic was killed in an auto accident.

Expectations: The United States, 1945-1974", Beginning in 1945  America rocketed through a quarter century of extraordinary economic growth  experiencing an amazing boom that soared to unimaginable heights in the 1960s    At one point  in the late 1940s  American workers produced 57 percent of the planet s steel  62 percent of the oil  80 percent of the automobiles  The U S  then had three fourths of the world s gold supplies  English Prime Minister Edward Heath later said that the United States in the post War era enjoyed  the greatest prosperity the world has ever known   It was a boom that produced a national euphoria  a buoyant time of grand expectations and an unprecedented faith in our government  in our leaders  and in the American dream  an optimistic spirit which would be shaken by events in the  60s and  70s  and particularly by the Vietnam War   Now  in  Grand Expectations   James T  Patterson has written a highly readable and balanced work that weaves the major political  cultural  and economic events of the period into a superb portrait of America from 1945 through Watergate  Here is an era teeming with memorable events  from the bloody campaigns in Korea and the bitterness surrounding McCarthyism to the assassinations of the Kennedys and Martin Luther King  to the Vietnam War  Watergate  and Nixon s resignation  Patterson excels at portraying the amazing growth after World War II  the great building boom epitomized by Levittown  the largest such development in history  and the baby boom  which exploded literally nine months after V J Day   as well as the resultant buoyancy of spirit reflected in everything from streamlined toasters  to big  flashy cars  to the soaring  butterfly roof of TWA s airline terminal in New York  And he shows how this upbeat  can do mood spurred grander and grander expectations as the era progressed   Of course  not all Americans shared in this economic growth  and an important thread running through the book is an informed and gripping depiction of the civil rights movement  from the electrifying  Brown v  Board of Education  decision  to the violent confrontations in Little Rock  Birmingham  and Selma  to the landmark civil rights acts of 1964 and 1965  Patterson also shows how the Vietnam War  which provoked LBJ s growing credibility gap  vast defense spending that dangerously unsettled the economy  and increasingly angry protests  and a growing rights revolution  including demands by women  Hispanics  the poor  Native Americans  and gays  triggered a backlash that widened hidden rifts in our society  rifts that divided along racial  class  and generational lines  And by Nixon s resignation  we find a national mood in stark contrast to the grand expectations of ten years earlier  one in which faith in our leaders and in the attainability of the American dream was greatly shaken    The Oxford History of the United States  The Oxford History of the United States is the most respected

 diplomatic  and military history into coherent and vividly written narrative   ,Black Mass: Apocalyptic Religion and the Death of Utopia, For the decade that followed the end of the cold war  the world was lulled into a sense that a consumerist  globalized  peaceful future beckoned  The beginning of the twenty first century has rudely disposed of such ideas  most obviously through 9 11and its aftermath  But just as damaging has been the rise in the West of a belief that a single model of political behaviour will become a worldwide norm and that  if necessary  it will be enforced at gunpoint    In  Black Mass   celebrated philosopher and critic John Gray explains how utopian ideals have taken on a dangerous significance in the hands of right wing conservatives and religious zealots  He charts the history of utopianism  from the Reformation through the French Revolution and into the present  And most urgently  he describes how utopian politics have moved from the extremes of the political spectrum into mainstream politics  dominating the administrations of both George W  Bush and Tony Blair  and indeed coming to define the political centre  Far from having shaken off discredited ideology  Gray suggests  we are more than ever in its clutches    Black Mass  is a truly frightening and challenging work by one of Britain s leading political thinkers  John Gray is the author of many critically acclaimed books  including  Straw Dogs  and  Al Qaeda and What It Means to Be Modern   A regular contributor to  The New York Review of Books   he is a professor of European

2009-07-29,2009 Burgos bombing,,2009,7,29,"A van bomb carrying more than 300 kg of explosive went off on 29 July 2009 outside a Civil Guard barracks in the northern city of Burgos, Spain, injuring at least 65 people. The attack was blamed on Basque separatist group Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (ETA).[1] Several children were among the 65 wounded in the attack. Some days before the attack, Spanish police warned that the organization might be trying a series of van bomb attacks[2] after they found information of three vans being carried to Spain in a document seized from arrested members Asier Borrero, Itziar Plaza and Iurgi Garitagoitia a few weeks before the attack.[3][4] About 120 people, one-third of them children, were sleeping in the building when the bomb went off at around 4:00 am local time (0200 UTC), blowing off most of its facade. The blast also left a two-metre (six-foot) deep crater in the street outside the barracks and heavily damaged the 14 storey residential complex and other buildings in the area.[5] The day after the bombing, a car bomb explosion on the island of Majorca killed two civil guards, Carlos Sáenz de Tejada García, 28, and Diego Salva Lezaun, 26. The two attacks came few hours before the 50th anniversary of the foundation of the organization. 42°21′23″N 3°41′36″W﻿ / ﻿42.35639°N 3.69333°W﻿ / 42.35639; -3.69333 ",http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Atentado%20de%20Burgos%201.jpg,The Immortals,"An elaborate heist unites 8 strangers in a simultaneous assault on targets all over the city- and explodes in a hailstorm of gunfire and high-speed chases in this powerful action-thriller.
